            <p id="t1">Preserving our health primarily depends on our eating habits. Illnesses can be prevented and cured merely by paying attention to our diet. The required nutrition for people of different age, gender and occupation may differ, but the proper rate of nutrition intake is mainly the same.<br><br>The Food Pyramid helps in calculating the proper amounts of different foodstuffs. It not only informs of the different foods but also displays the suggested amount of intake. Eat the most of the foods at the bottom of the pyramid and gradually try to have less of the ones in the higher layers.</p>

            <p id="t2">The lowest layer of the pyramid is made up of foods rich in carbohydrate. Cereals, pastries, pastas take care of our energy supplies. Consume  as much as possible of these. The next level is for vegetables and fruits. They provide vitamins and minerals for our body that are necessary for its proper functioning. The next are protein-high foodstuffs. These are dairy products, eggs and meat. Try eating more fish and less red meats. This group includes various legumes and drupes due to their high protein and energy levels. The top level consists of sugars, fats and spices. These are poor in nourishment, have as little as possible of these.</p>
